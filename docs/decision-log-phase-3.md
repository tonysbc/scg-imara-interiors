# Phase 3: Online Boutique — Decision Log

## [2026-02-23] Decision: Dedicated Shop Route Architecture
**Decision:** Create a dedicated `/shop` directory with dynamic route `/shop/[id]`.
**Rationale:** While the homepage features a curated selection, the "Boutique" vision requires a full-page experience for browsing the complete catalog, allowing for deep storytelling for each artisanal piece.
**Status:** Active.

## [2026-02-23] Decision: Inquiry-Led Commerce Strategy
**Decision:** Prioritize "Inquire" over "Add to Cart" for the boutique.
**Rationale:** Aligns with the "Conscious Luxury" and "Personal Connection" values of Chiko's brand. High-end artisanal pieces in Arusha often require personal logistics or custom finishing.
**Status:** Active.

## [2026-02-23] Decision: Integrated Blog for Thought Leadership
**Decision:** Implement a dedicated `/blog` route, branded as **"Studio Notes"**.
**Rationale:** "Studio Notes" offers a more tactile, behind-the-scenes authenticity compared to "Journal" or "Blog." It reinforces the brand's connection to the Sombetini workshop and Chiko's personal design process.
**Status:** Active.
